## 💎 What Makes AlgoVision Unique

### 1. **True 3D Immersion**
Unlike other visualizers that use 2D animations, AlgoVision offers a full 3D WebGL-powered experience using React Three Fiber. Users can rotate, zoom, and explore algorithms from any angle.

### 2. **Variable Watcher**
No other visualizer shows live variable states. AlgoVision displays `i`, `j`, `queue`, `visited`, etc., in real-time, making it invaluable for debugging and learning.

### 3. **Interactive Graph Building**
Users can build graphs by clicking on the canvas—no need to type edge lists. This visual approach makes graph theory accessible to beginners.

### 4. **Camera Automation**
The camera automatically follows the action. During BFS/DFS, users don't need to manually track nodes—the view adapts to focus on the current operation.

### 5. **Professional Dark Mode UI**
A sleek, modern glassmorphism design with vibrant gradients, smooth animations, and a cohesive color palette that rivals commercial software.

### 6. **Comprehensive Algorithm Suite**
From sorting to hashing, from stacks to graphs—AlgoVision covers the entire DSA curriculum in one platform.
