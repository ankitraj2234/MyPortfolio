### User Input

I added three screenshots in the education tab. When I'm moving on the tiles there is no background kind of animation which we are having. That foggy animation of that color is not there you. Are good to see that if there will be the same that color you have used in the UI should have animation in the background. Another two screenshot is having animation but color is different so fix that too.

### User Input

There are two few reasons I'm going to shift this development from here now to any other system. In the same anti gravity IDE. So I need a proper documentation which will involve and include all the development steps and everything we had in this project like all the features according to tabs, all the technologies we are using all the technologies for, every feature for any animation. If you are using any technology for how we came to any solution for any. Big problem in our project. So I need each and every detail. So that I can give that file to that anti gravity IDE and AI agent. In that we realize that how this project is what this project is along with the project files I will give full file control to him. I will start developing the same file. I will be copying this and pasting it there in the different system. So I'll giving him to analyze that you can analyze the all projects and also that you can follow that empty file that how we came to the development. So that development should carry all the steps how we came to the development, how that area came to picture, how we like step by step all the details for that project. We need that for the AI to start the growth of this project. From that system, so. Will be postponing. The development here for a little time. So we will be doing the development there only OK. So I will need that system also make that anti gravity ID known about that that this project is already developed from anti gravity IDE and due to some error and or 'cause we are sifting the system so we cannot shift this chat or something like that OK so create a proper documentation OK. Also I need that if there is any any way. That we can copy this whole chat which we have in this development with the all project files and paste it in there anti gravity. If is this possible tell me that way too.
